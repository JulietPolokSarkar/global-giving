                <p>Hunger is still one the biggest - and most solvable - problems in the world. We have already made
                    incredible progress: there are 300 million fewer hungry people now than in the 90's. It is possible
                    to end hunger.</p>

                    who have bravely fled abuse to keep their kids safe, refugees seeking sanctuary from war and
                    violence, and families in crisis with nowhere else to go.</p>

            The cost to provide home, health, faith and education to each child varies around the world. However, we
            allow up to three sponsors per child because the true cost to raise a child within all of our partner homes
            exceed $38 per month. Your $38 per month combined with others allow our partner homes to give a child more
            than the basic necessities to survive, but the skills and opportunities to thrive as they transition to
            adulthood.
