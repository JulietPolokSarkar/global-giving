            Our Strategic Plan (2022-2025) sets the organization’s course for the next four years – outlining the many
            ways for us, working in synergy with others, to most efficiently and effectively save and change lives. It
            is grounded within renewed global commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its
            associated Sustainable Development Goals.

                <p>Hunger is still one the biggest - and most solvable - problems in the world. We have already made
                    incredible progress: there are 300 million fewer hungry people now than in the 90's. It is possible
                    to end hunger.</p>

                <p>When families have nowhere else to turn, they can find sanctuary and support at the Red Door - moms
                    who have bravely fled abuse to keep their kids safe, refugees seeking sanctuary from war and
                    violence, and families in crisis with nowhere else to go.</p>
